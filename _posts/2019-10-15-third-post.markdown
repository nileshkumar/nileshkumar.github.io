### High Priority Emails

We all have seen sending High priority mails in our MS-Outlook/Thunderbird mail clients. 
If we want to achieve same in Rails, we have to use the syntax as mentioned below in our mailer model file:

{% highlight ruby %}
 def send_high_priority_mail
 email_params.merge!({
        'Importance' => 'high', # for all mail clients supporting MIME RFC 4021
        'X-Priority' => '1', # for newer Outlooks
        'X-MSMail-Priority' => 'High' # for older Outlooks
      })
     
    mail(email_params)
 end
{% endhighlight %}

Now prioritize your email... :)
