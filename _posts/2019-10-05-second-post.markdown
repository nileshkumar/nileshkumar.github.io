###Time Difference
Many times while development we need to have the difference of timestamps. But in Rails we canâ€™t simply subtract the timestamps to get the difference.
We can achieve this by following code:
{% highlight ruby %}
(Time.parse(DateTime.now.to_s) - Time.parse(current_user.created_at.to_s))/3600
{% endhighlight %}

Now try it out in your code..  :)
